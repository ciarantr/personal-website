**Welcome to the repository of my portfolio website!**

The key motivation behind this project was to create a dynamic representation of my coding expertise. This portfolio leverages the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/) to retrieve data from projects I've worked on.


## Projects Showcase ![projects icon](https://api.iconify.design/material-symbols-light:wallpaper-slideshow.svg?color=%23888888&width=24&height=24)
